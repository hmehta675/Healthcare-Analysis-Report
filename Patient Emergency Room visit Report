# Patient Emergency Room visit Report

Problem Statement:
Create a dashboard for an emergency department of a hospital.
1. Average Wait Time: Discover how long patients typically wait before their appointments. Uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the efficiency of our healthcare system.
2. Patient Satisfaction: We'll explore the average satisfaction scores given by our patients. Learn about the factors that contribute to a positive patient experience and how we can enhance it.
3. Total Patient Visits Monthly: Get an overview of the ebb and flow of patients through our doors each month. Understand the dynamics of healthcare demand over time.
4. Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: Delve into the data to distinguish between appointments that involve administrative processes and those that don't. Explore the impact on wait times and patient satisfaction.
5. Referrals and Walk-In Patients: Uncover the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who walk in without prior referral. How does this impact the overall patient experience?
6. Patient Visits by Age Group and Race: Explore the distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races. Gain insights into the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences.

Steps Followed:

1. Loaded the data set from the excel file.
2. Transformed the date for the date field using Power Query in PowerBI.
3. Created 2 new coloumns for age bins and age groups (Infant, Early Childhood, Middle Childhood, Teenager, Adult)
4. After transforming we need some measures that we need to create using DAX functions for average wait time, average statisfaction score, % of male, female and unknown gender visits, Conditional formationg for month, year, heat map caption, max and min value for the patient count by month.
5. Created a parameter for avg wait time and avg satisfaction score for using both in one single heatmap
6. Started creating the visualzations with the help of charts, graphs, line, and added custom designs by designing the dashboard in powerpoint and loading it back in Power BI.
7. Added Sparkline to certain measure to add an additional beauty to the scores.
